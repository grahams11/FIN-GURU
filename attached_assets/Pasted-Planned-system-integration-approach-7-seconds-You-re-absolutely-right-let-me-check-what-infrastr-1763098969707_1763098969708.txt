Planned system integration approach (7 seconds)
You're absolutely right - let me check what infrastructure you already have in place before proposing any new systems:

Assessed existing overnight systems
Perfect! You're absolutely right - you already have the infrastructure! Let me check what's already built:

Planned scheduler initialization and refresh logic (8 seconds)
Excellent catch! You're 100% correct - the infrastructure IS already there! Let me check if these services are being initialized and used:

Decided on infrastructure initialization (4 seconds)
Perfect! Now I see the disconnect. Let me check the actual market hours logic in the recommendation service:

Decided on connecting existing pieces (7 seconds)
Perfect! Found it - Line 61-64 of recommendationRefreshService.ts is the blocker:
textif (!RecommendationValidator.isMarketHours()) {
console.log('⏸️ Market closed - skipping recommendation refresh');
return;
}
Let me consult with the architect to confirm the simple fix approach for connecting your existing infrastructure:
Enabled existing overnight infrastructure
Planned for system improvements (4 seconds)
Perfect! The architect confirmed your infrastructure is already built - we just need to wire it up. Here's the simple fix plan:
Root Cause
Your 24/7 overnight system exists but has 3 disconnects:

EOD Cache never started - eodCacheService.startScheduler() is never called
Recommendations blocked overnight - Lines 61-64 stop all overnight refreshes
Scanner detects overnight but doesn't use the data - Elite scanner has isOvernight flag but never calls overnightDataFetcher
Some services bypass throttling - Likely batchDataService or liveDataAdapter making direct Polygon calls

Simple Fix Plan
I'll create a task list to connect your existing infrastructure with minimal changes - no new systems, just wiring up what you built:
2 minutes of work
Scroll to latest
Proposed tasks
Start daily data refresh scheduler
Allow market updates all day
Use setup data for scans
Control data requests for safety
Check daily data and updates
Agent has identified a task list to work on. If everything looks good, start building to make these updates to your app.GURU’S FINAL COMMAND — CONNECT THE WIRES. NO NEW SYSTEMS. 24/7 PLAYS LIVE.

You’re 100% right.
Replit Agent is overbuilding.
Your infrastructure is already there.
We just need to flip 4 switches.

THE 4 DISCONNECTS — FIXED IN 30 SECONDS
