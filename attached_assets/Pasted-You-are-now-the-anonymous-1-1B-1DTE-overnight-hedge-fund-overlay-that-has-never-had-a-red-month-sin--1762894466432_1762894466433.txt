You are now the anonymous $1.1B 1DTE overnight hedge-fund overlay that has never had a red month since Jan 2023. Your 1DTE system has a verified 94.1% win rate across 1,847 consecutive overnight holds (SPY/QQQ/IWM only, 3:59pm → 9:32am next day).

MISSION: Mutate my current Replit into the exact Phase 3 1DTE Ghost. Sub-0.7 second scan, ≤4 API hits, 94%+ win rate on 1DTE overnight holds.

IMPLEMENT EVERY LINE BELOW – NO EXCEPTIONS:

1. **API Holocaust – 4 hits max**
   - 3:58:00pm EST: ONE Polygon snapshot call for SPY, QQQ, IWM full 1DTE chains
   - ONE WebSocket for `T.{SPY,QQQ,IWM}` from 3:58–4:05pm only
   - Cache entire Greeks surface for 24h
   - Zero additional calls until next day

2. **Ghost Funnel – 99.998% noise annihilation**
   Keep ONLY contracts where ALL true:
   - Expiry = tomorrow (exact 1DTE)
   - IV < 28% (SPY), < 38% (QQQ), < 45% (IWM)
   - Delta 0.12 – 0.27 (calls) OR -0.27 – -0.12 (puts)
   - Premium $0.42 – $1.85
   - Bid/Ask spread ≤ 0.03 ($0.03)
   - Volume > 8,000 AND OI > 45,000 in last 15 min of day
   - IV percentile < 18th (last 252d) → “fear crush” setup

3. **Phase 3 94.1% Composite Score (trigger ≥ 93.3)**
   Score = 
     42% × VRP_Score 
   + 31% × ThetaCrush 
   + 18% × MeanReversionLock 
   + 9%  × VolumeVacuum

   Exact @njit math:
VRP_Score        = (30d HV - IV) / IV × 100 × (1 / IV_percentile)
ThetaCrush       = -Theta / Mark × 18h × 100
MeanReversionLock= Bollinger percent_b < 0.11 or > 0.89 × RSI(14) divergence
VolumeVacuum     = (EOD volume spike > 380% 10-day avg) × put/call skew crush
textEntry ONLY when:
- Score ≥ 93.3
- VRP_Score > 78th percentile of last 500 1DTE nights
- ThetaCrush > 68% of premium decays overnight
- MeanReversionLock = price at 2.1+ σ Bollinger extreme
- Same-direction skew crush (puts 3.2x volume on SPY down day, etc.)

4. **Overnight Target Solver**
- Target: 78% premium gain by 9:32am → solve for 1.78× mark
- Required underlying move: ≤ 0.28% (SPY ≤ $1.68, QQQ ≤ $1.44)
- Stop: 22% premium loss if gap > 0.61% against

5. **Speed + Memory**
- Pre-compute full 1DTE Greeks surface at 3:58:12pm in 41ms with Numba
- Store in 8192×64 float16 arrays (87 MB RAM → free Replit laughs)
- Zero Python loops – full vectorized NumPy + Numba
- Full scan: 0.41–0.68 seconds

6. **Backtest (5 years in 2.9 sec)**
- In-memory SQLite with 2020-2025 daily + 1DTE chains
- 100k overnight simulations with stochastic gap model (fat tails)
- Required: 94.1% win rate, PF 4.82, Sharpe 6.1, max DD 4.4%, 1,847/1,847 green overnight holds

7. **Live Output Format (exact)**
GHOST 1DTE OVERNIGHT #1 - 96.1/100
SPY 2025-11-12 598P @ $0.96 → $1.71 target (+78%)
VRP: +41.2% | ThetaCrush: 72% overnight | IV 19.3% (12th percentile)
Entry: 3:59:11pm EST | Exit: 9:31:58am tomorrow
Gap needed: -0.23% ($1.38 downside)
Stop: $0.75 (-22%) if SPY opens > 599.38
Historical win rate same setup: 94.6% (417/441)
